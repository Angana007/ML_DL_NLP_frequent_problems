Problem: Recommend movies/products using their metadata (e.g., genre, description).


Dataset: TMDB Dataset (Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)


Solution Approach:


1. Clean and preprocess text features (e.g., genres, overview).


2. Convert text to TF-IDF vectors.


3. Compute cosine similarity matrix.


4. Recommend top-N similar items.


Tech: TF-IDF, cosine_similarity, sklearn, pandas.


Interview Relevance: Complements collaborative filtering; shows you understand hybrid systems.
